Overview of the project
-----------------------

This project was made as part of a workshop for young students.

The primary focus of the workshop is to give the students a taste of the
IT-professions through small exersises and projects.

In order to make these things exciting to engage with, the activities were based
on embedded devices, namely Arduino and Raspberry Pi’s. This also fits nicely
into the overall theme which is “build an internet cafe”.
These documents only describe the Raspberry Pi parts.

Activities
----------

Short introduction to Raspberry Pi.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is it? What can it do, and what can be said about the hardware?

See :doc:`The Raspberry Pi page<raspberry>` for more.

Assembling Ethernet cables.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(WIP) Each group cuts a piece of cable, and attach two RJ45 connectors.
write a small instruction thingy here.

Testing cables and joining a local network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once cables have been tested and verified to work, groups connect through a
switch to a local network where a chat server is running.

The server and client software is an example of something that we developed, and
it makes for a nice segway to talk a bit about networking and protocols.

See :doc:`pypes` for documentation of the software.

(IDEA) Possibly some scripting related tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The whole theme here is setting up a netcafe, which involves configuring
several machines similarly. This can be tedious to do one by one. This would
be a perfect example of something that can be automated through scripting.

Install RetroPie. Turn the desktop computer into a gaming system.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the :term:`RetroPie` documentation, the students will configure the machines
with a new operating system. When finished they get to play games for the
remainder of the day, so this should be scheduled to be within a
reasonable time before the end of the day.
